\chapter[Data and objectives]{Data and objectives}
\label{kap:data_and_objectives}

In this chapter we will take a closer look at the data we are using. We will cover the biological aspect of 
the data and compare the data we have to other kinds of data. We will also look at how such data are obtained 
and how they are further processed. 

\section{What kind of data we are using}
This just a citation so I know what I need to address later:
Script sondovac\_part\_a.sh requires as input files:
1) Transcriptome input file in FASTA format. Note: For technical reasons, the 
   labels of FASTA sequences must be unique numbers (no other characters). 
   Sondovaƒç will check the labels, and if they are not in an appropriate form, 
   a copy of this input file with correct labels will be created.
2) Plastome reference sequence input file in FASTA format.
3) Paired-end genome skim input file in FASTQ format (two files - forward and 
   reverse reads).
4) OPTIONAL: Mitochondriome reference sequence input file in FASTA format.
   This file is not required.
