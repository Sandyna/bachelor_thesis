\label{kap:data_and_objectives}

In this chapter we will take a closer look at the data we are using. We will cover the biological aspect of 
the data and compare the data we have to other kinds of data. We will also look at how such data are obtained 
and how they are further processed. 

\section{What kind of data we are using}
The Sondovac script uses a transcriptome and a paired-end genome skim raw data as a base - to get orthologous LCN loci. 
It also uses plastome reference sequence which it removes from the skim data. Additionally, the Sondovac can use mitochondriome 
reference sequence for the same purpose. Finally, the probes are checked for any remaining plastome reference sequences.
