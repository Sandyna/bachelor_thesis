\chapter[Possible Improvements]{Possible Improvements}
\label{kap:improvements}

In this chapter we will suggest possible improvements to the pipeline and go through the various approaches to the problem. 
We will also describe main parts of the actual code and algorithms used. 



\subsubsection{Nickel and metal binding genes}

\subsubsection{Input data}

\subsubsection{About aligning}
We used bowtie2 for aligning the genes to our results. 

\subsection{Input and output}

\subsection{binary search}
We will not use this. 

\section{Maximalization of space}

\subsection{Greedy vs Knapsack}

\subsection{Combined approach}

\section{results}
